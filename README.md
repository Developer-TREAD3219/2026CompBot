# FRC 2026 "REBUILT"

## LED Subsystem

### Assumptions

- We'll be using the [AndyMark fc-TB-9109 12v Individually Addressable LEDs](https://www.thethriftybot.com/products/12v-individually-addressable-leds).
- The LED strip will wrap arround the edge of the robot frame (27in x 27in).

### LED Power Requirements

The power requirements may be found here: [Power Budget](https://docs.thethriftybot.com/thrifty-12v-addressable-leds/power-budget)

The LED strip has 60 LEDs per meter. Each LED requires 30mA (1.8A/m). Our bots perimeter is 108 inches or 2.74 meters. So, at 1.8A/m we have ~5A (60W).
